    <h2>Ranking of structures</h2>
	<h3 name="S1">How structures are ranked</h3>	
	<p>StructureVis supports ranking of structures by their one-dimensional or two-dimensional data values to assist the investigator in mining out structures which may be of the interest. 
	<br/><br/>A structure is ranked by comparing the distribution of data values corresponding to the structure for a particular a data source against all data values for the same data source using a Mann-Whitney U test.
	<br/><br/>The Mann-Whitney U test generates a z-score which gives an indication of whether a particular structure lies at an extreme of the distribution of all data values in a data source. For example, a large negative z-score for a particular structure means that the median value for a structure is significantly less than the median data value for all data values in the data source, whereas a z-score close to zero indicates that the structure does not contain data values that are significantly different from the rest. 
	<br/><br/>Structures that lie at an extreme (high or low z-score) are typically the most interesting.

	<h3 name="S2">How to rank structures</h3>	
	<p>Select <b>Rank structures</b> from the <b>Analysis menu</b> and then select the desired data source to rank against from the <b>Data source</b> menu.
	</p>
	<h3 name="S3">Ranking options</h3>	
	<ol style="font-size:1em">
		<li>
		<b>All nucleotides</b> - all non-empty values within a structure are compared against all non-empty values in the data source. Note for two-dimensional data sources the number of data values may be may be very large (sequence_length<sup>2</sup>), given that the ranking test will consider every non-empty pair of nucleotides in the sequence and it may take a long time to run.
		</li>
		<li>
		<b>Paired only</b> - all non-empty values corresponding to paired nucleotides within a structure are compared against all non-empty values corresponding to paired nucleotides in the data source. In the case of a two-dimensional overlay the ranking test only considers pairs of nucleotides which are paired in the structure, thus greatly reducing the number of data points it needs to consider.
		</li>
		<li>
		<b>Unpaired only</b> - all non-empty values corresponding to unpaired nucleotides within a structure are compared against all non-empty values corresponding to unpaired nucleotides in the data source. Note: as with the "All nucleotides" option, this may take a long time to run for two-dimensional data sources.
