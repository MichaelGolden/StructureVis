	<h3 name="S1">How to create a 1D data source</h3>	
	<p>When using the dataset creation wizard on your own custom dataset it is necessary to get your data into a format that StructureVis can recognize.
	In order to do this for one-dimensional data overlays, StructureVis requires a CSV file and a corresponding mapping alignment. 
	<br/><br/>Paste your data into your favourite spreadsheet editor, where the columns represent different data items (above right). The first row can be optionally used to label the data.

	<br/>Typically you will only require two columns in your spreadsheet: a position column and a data column for a single data item (although more data columns can be specified if you so wish).
	The position column is a list of coordinates that correspond to column positions in the mapping alignment (above right), where 1 corresponds to the first nucleotide column. The data column is a list of numeric data values.
	In the example above there are two data columns: 'SHAPE reactivity' and 'Pairing probability'. For illustration purposes a 'Base' column has been added to show how the positions should correspond to the mapping alignment.
	<br/><br/>Once you have completed creating your spreadsheet, save it as a CSV (Comma Seperated Values) file. It can now be loaded into the dataset creator, see below:
